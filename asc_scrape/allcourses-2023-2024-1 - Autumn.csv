The course would introduce various theoretical perspectives in design in relation to the socio-cultural issues of the present, structured around thematic areas of investigation. Students will learn to use theoretical lenses to define, analyse, and explain design artefacts. Through these lenses, students will explore questions such as, How does design and the designer interact with specific social phenomena? How do they influence each other? and, How are existing social structures mediated and propagated through design? Specific theories that the course will cover include: Semiotics and Communication, Labour and Work, Language and Power, Gender and Gendering, Universalism and Regionalism etc. Over all This course will guide students to: • Analyse design interventions through various historical and theoretical lenses. • Develop awareness towards diverse narratives of power, identity, representation, technology, sustainability, agency, and several other such issues. • Engage in critical dialogue to understand the social, cultural, environmental, and ethical implications of design objects and practices. Throughout the course, real-life examples will be used to illustrate and explain theories.",7.9411764705882355,8.0,7.0,1.2485285456935955,2,4,0,0,4,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Elements of Mechanical Engineering, K R Gopala Krishna, Subhash Publications, 2008"," The scientific revolution of the 17th century -- mechanics of the craftsmen and mathematics of the scholars are fused to explain the Universe.  The 18th century enlightenment movement and growing dominance of the scientific worldview.  The 19th century steam engine and electric generator, and the industrial revolution. Evolutionary perspectives in geology, biology and society. The professionalization of Science and development of its secular and elite character. The 20th century - the birth of new physics and chemistry of the atomic and subatomic world, and related technologies. The birth of computing machines, aerodynamic and space technologies. The growing knowledge of cellular and molecular biology, and human diseases. The 21st century - the global concerns for public health and pandemics, ecological devastation and agricultural crisis, social and economic inequality, remain and continue to grow.  Overview of Thermal engineering: The thermal and fluids engineering stream deals with processes that deal with transfer of energy and motion of fluids, in both coupled and uncoupled manner. Since a significant section of mechanical engineering deals with generation of power, and almost the entirety of this power is generated by means of techniques that deal with transferring energy from some form to another form, thermal and fluids engineering plays a significant role. Besides the generation of power, most systems from mechanical engineering have to deal with either absorption or dissipation of heat, and with some or other form of fluids. Hence, the principles learnt in this stream are useful throughout the entire domain of mechanical engineering. Overview of Design engineering: The design stream deals with the conceptualization of the machine that needs to be produced. The process begins with a thorough assessment of the need of such a machine. Once the necessities are clearly ascertained, the design process in initiated involving various methodologies of analysis, such as stress analysis, thermal analysis, analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of the machine including the transfer of motion and power, an analysis of manufacturability, etc. The analysis is conducted on both the machine as a composite unit as well as its components. Finally, the drawings of the manufacturable design are created and passed on to the engineers specializing in the manufacturing stream. Overview of Manufacturing engineering: The manufacturing stream is involved with the manufacturing of components for the machines that were designed by the engineers specializing in the design stream. The process begins with identification of the proper raw materials, moves on to the choice of the machines that would be utilized for machining the components, and finally the machining process itself with its associated controls over dimensions and tolerances. Engineers in this stream are constantly attempting to innovate methodologies that allow production of the machines and their components with the best of quality, but with also with least amounts of debris and the least possible cost.",6.611111111111111,7.0,5.0,2.1027605200903254,20,20,1,0,29,30,33,35,26,2,0,0,0,0,0,2

Simulation of phonons using non-local forces (molecular dynamics) and quantum mechanics principles (only a brief introduction for completeness), and measurements using a continuous and pulsed laser, x-ray, and neutron will be outlined. Based on statistical mechanics, expressions correlating phonons and thermodynamic properties (Helmholtz free energy, enthalpy, internal energy, entropy, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, heat capacity) will be derived, solved, and compared with measurements. Applicability of Fourier’s law in the diffusive regime and its breakdown in ballistic and quasi-ballistic regime will be reviewed. Measurement techniques (NIR pump and soft x-ray probe, transient grating, time-domain thermoreflectance) and modeling of thermal energy transport in ballistic and quasi-ballistic regime will be discussed.

While the course`s foundation lies in the tools of probability, statistics and quantitative methods, we will strive to help understand the strengths (and weaknesses) of using quantitative information (data), as well as develop frameworks and mindset to both utilize and question the kinds of analytics they may encounter from the executive vantage point. It will also guide them in what kinds of analytics they should be asking for, given the current state of modern data science and methodology. This course uses case studies when appropriate. We will employ situational examples in which critical decisions are made in the face of uncertainty and analytics are deployed to shed light on key issues and relationships. We will examine situations that require the filtering and processing of available data, as well as circumstances that force the use of judicious assumptions and “what-if” analyses. The operating assumption of this course is that the quality (and performance) of business choices and actions will improve unambiguously if senior managers: • Get/filter/distill the information that matters most and ask critical and skeptical questions • Interpret and convert analytical outputs into knowledge • Reduce uncertainty and apply analytics to bolster judgment The circumstances to which the above three steps can apply are broad. Moreover, the thinking process developed is generalizable to areas beyond business management. The objectives of this course are to: A. Provide for students a relevant and usable toolkit to improve comprehension of business problems B. Engage and drive student interest in making analytically sound decisions C. Provide tools that will serve them both in furthering their careers",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

PS 644 offered in Spring will have PS 643 as a prerequisite. While PS626 was only available to grad students, PS643 is also open to final year undergrads.   This course is an interdisciplinary introductory course for AI and policy. It will bring the student up to scratch with the landscape of extant policymaking on AI as well as make certain they learn the basic concepts, digital and philosophical, of AI, machine learning, and data, learn to code a small AI artefact, learn about basic AI and data policy and governance structures as they exist in India and worldwide, and the ongoing debates on the same. By the end of the course, the student would have learnt a basic amount of what AI technologies are, how data interacts with them, how they influence and are influenced by the world, and how to design policy around them. Students with a background in technology but wishing to learn the social impact of AI, or conversely with a background in the social sciences wishing to understand the technology of AI, will be benefited from this course. There are no prerequisites to this course but there are expectations the student will learn.

PS 644 offered in Spring will have PS 643 as a prerequisite. While PS626 was only available to grad students, PS643 is also open to final year undergrads.   This course is an interdisciplinary introductory course for AI and policy. It will bring the student up to scratch with the landscape of extant policymaking on AI as well as make certain they learn the basic concepts, digital and philosophical, of AI, machine learning, and data, learn to code a small AI artefact, learn about basic AI and data policy and governance structures as they exist in India and worldwide, and the ongoing debates on the same. By the end of the course, the student would have learnt a basic amount of what AI technologies are, how data interacts with them, how they influence and are influenced by the world, and how to design policy around them. Students with a background in technology but wishing to learn the social impact of AI, or conversely with a background in the social sciences wishing to understand the technology of AI, will be benefited from this course. There are no prerequisites to this course but there are expectations the student will learn.

In first module, it provides an overview of affirmative action, including its definition and historical background. It also examines the pre-independence scenario and explores how states like Kolhapur, Travancore, Mysore, and the state of Madras extended affirmative action. In second module, the course delves into the draft constitution and explores how the Constituent Assembly handled matters related to affirmative action. In third module, it examines the provisions in the Constitution that aim to extend affirmative action. It highlights three distinct ways in which the Constitution sought to achieve this goal. Additionally, it analyzes the Champakam Dorairajan case and the first amendment to the Constitution. In fourth module, the course discusses the report of the Mandal Commission and the Indra Sawhney case. It also explores the Constitutional amendment pertaining to affirmative action in promotion. In fifth module, it focuses on the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution, which expanded affirmative action by providing reservation of constituencies for women in Panchayati Raj. In sixth module, the course covers subsequent amendments, including notable cases such as Nagraj, Jarnail Singh, and the reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS). In seventh and final module, the course concludes by comparing India`s approach to affirmative action with other jurisdictions that have implemented similar policies.",7.956521739130435,8.0,7.0,1.3479049766533828,31,23,0,14,39,46,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The perspective of the course is critical and technical. It will illuminate the explicit and tacit knowledge underlying the practice of urban planning in India. Through a case study approach, students will understand the diversity of urban planning practices, as well as the challenges faced in provision of urban infrastructural services at different scales. Through actual site visits and small problem-solving exercises, students will explore sectoral interconnectedness and gaps. The course is also designed to enable students to think through urban challenges using multipronged strategic interventions. 9.
